Course Page
===========

The **Course Page** can be accessed either via the quick link *Last Course* or through the course overview in the :doc:`Profile <\profile>`. It serves as the central information and entry page for a course.

Course Overview
---------------

The course overview displays the **Course Image** (if available), the **Title**, the **Description**, and the **Authors** of the course. In addition, important metadata of the course are shown:

  - Number of nano modules
  - Number of chapters
  - Estimated total duration

Below this metadata, there is an action button whose label changes depending on the course status:

- **Add to Learning Plan** button: Displayed when the course has not yet been started (enrollment in the course)
- **Start** button: Displayed once the user is enrolled. Redirects to the :doc:`Learner View <\learning-view>` of the course
- **Continue** button: Displayed when learning units have already been completed. Resumes the course at the most recently worked position

Below the course description, the :ref:`Course Structure <course-structure>` is displayed.

Course Structure
----------------

Courses are divided by authors in the :doc:`Course Editor <\course-editor>` into chapters, allowing for thematic structuring of the learning content. Each chapter section lists the corresponding nano modules, which can be worked through sequentially.
