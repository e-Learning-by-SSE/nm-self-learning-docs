Content Hierarchy and Granularity
=================================

The `SELF-le@rn Platform` organizes learning content in a hierarchical structure that enables systematic and scalable management of educational materials.

.. glossary::

   Subject Areas
      Broad thematic domains categorized by academic disciplines such as Computer Science, Mathematics, or Psychology. Subject Areas form the highest organizational level and include various specializations.

   Specializations
      Groupings of thematically related courses within a Subject Area. A specialization in Computer Science, for example, could be “Artificial Intelligence” or “Web Development.”

   Courses
      Structured curricula designed for the systematic delivery of learning content. Each course is divided into several chapters and follows a didactic concept.

   Chapters
      Thematic subdivisions of a course that cover central learning domains. Chapters contain a collection of related nanomodules.

   Nanomodules
      The smallest learning units on the platform, typically requiring about 15 minutes to complete. Each nanomodule consists of at least one learning resource and one assessment, and conveys specific skills.

   Skills
      Concrete abilities and competencies conveyed through nanomodules. Skills can be organized hierarchically and interconnected to model complex learning paths.
